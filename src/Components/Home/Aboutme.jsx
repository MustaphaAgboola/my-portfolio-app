        ABOUT ME
      </h1>
      <p>
        My name is <span className=" text-yellow-400">Mustapha Agboola</span>,
        I'm always passionate about learning and exploring new technolonogies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier this year, I got an opportunity to learn software engineering at
        Senator Abiru Innovation Lab alongside other amiable participant and it
        has been an awesome experience, over the past seven month I have learnt
        how to write <span className=" text-yellow-400">HTML, CSS</span> and{" "}
        <span className=" text-yellow-400">JAVASCRIPT </span>
        and I have also learnt to use frameworks and library like{" "}
        <span className=" text-yellow-400">REACTJS, TAILWINDCSS </span> AND
        <span className=" text-yellow-400"> EXPRESS. </span>
        But beyond these technical skills, I believe in the importance of
        user-centric design, accessibility, and creating elegant solutions that
        make a positive impact on people's lives. I have also built projects
        individually and with team. This portfolio is a showcase of my projects,
        each representing a milestone in my learning journey. I hope you'll
        enjoy exploring the code and designs that reflect my passion for
        problem-solving and attention to detail. As I continue to evolve as a
        developer, I'm eager to embrace new challenges, work on exciting
        projects, and collaborate with inspiring individuals and teams. I'm open
        to opportunities and always looking forward to connecting with
        like-minded professionals in the tech community. Thank you for visiting
        my portfolio, and I hope we can collaborate on something great together!
        Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on social media.
        Let's build the future together! ðŸš€
